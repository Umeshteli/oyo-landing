                <spna class="text-hightlight">A. EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”): </spna>Mission Bio is a global brand and thus may conduct business with individuals from within the European Economic Area (“EEA”). In order to carry out business with these individuals, we may transfer personal information from individuals (“Data Subjects”) located within the EEA. Personal information that may be collected by us from a Data Subject in the EEA may include:
              </p>
              <ul class="block-order-list fnt-sm py-2 py-md-3">
                <li class="block-order-list__item">Name</li>
                <li class="block-order-list__item">Address</li>
                <li class="block-order-list__item">Company/Institution</li>
                <li class="block-order-list__item">Phone Number</li>
                <li class="block-order-list__item">Email Address</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Mission Bio must potentially deal with local supervisory authorities in all EU states where we have an existing business relationship with a data subject. Additionally, information that we collect may be transferred outside of the EEA, including to countries, such as the United States, which have not been deemed as having “adequate” security measures by the European Commission. Therefore, we have executed Model Clauses between our European offices and Mission Bio, pursuant to European Commission Decision 2010/87/EC, to facilitate the legitimate, secure transfer of personal information outside the EEA as necessary.</p>
